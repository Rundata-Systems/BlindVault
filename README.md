# BlindVault - a secure secrets manager

# Why name this `BlindVault`?
From the [non-canon Star Trek reference!](https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Blindvault)

> Blindvaults were a special form of chamber which was used to store objects of value, to protect them from attempts at stealing them.
> These chambers were sensor proof, sound proof, transporter proof and all but impregnable, allowing individuals to store items with a high degree of security. They were designed and manufactured by the Ferengi, who naturally had a vested interest in keeping their valuables safe. Blindvaults were also sold to other species for similar uses.
