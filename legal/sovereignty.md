# Data Sovereignty

BlindVault (BV) provides a secrets management alternative for organizations
seeking to mitigate jurisdictional risk and dependence on United States-based
infrastructure and legal reach.

## Corporate Domicile

Rundata Systems is a registered South African company. All corporate
governance, intellectual property custody, and operational control reside
within the Republic of South Africa.

- **Legal Jurisdiction:** All service agreements and data handling are subject to South African judicial processes and the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA).
- **Extraterritoriality:** As a non-US entity, Rundata Systems is not directly subject to US CLOUD Act warrants or similar extraterritorial data seizure
mandates.


## Geographic Hosting

By default, the BlindVault service is hosted on infrastructure physically
located within the national borders of South Africa.

- **Default Locale:** South Africa (ZA).
- **Physical Isolation:** Production metadata and encrypted blobs remain on South African soil.


## In-Country Residency (National Borders)

For sovereign entities or regulated industries requiring data residency within their own national borders, BV offers custom deployment models:

- **National Hosting:** On request, BV can be provisioned on infrastructure located within a specific country's borders.
- **Service Model:** This is an expedited provisioning service available at additional cost to satisfy local regulatory or sovereignty requirements.
- **Managed Isolation:** Rundata Systems maintains the service while ensuring all KSK ceremonies and data persistence occur within the requested territory.


## Strategic Independence

BV is designed to provide continuity and security in an environment of
shifting international economic policies and erratic multi-national
leadership. We offer a stable, neutral alternative to traditional
secrets management providers.
